	(Octave script; C code accompanied with Gnuplot script)

ABOUT THE CODE:

This is the second assignment of the of the Computational Metallurgy Lab (MM3421).
This assignment contains rudimentary exercise for converting the cartesian coordinates
into polar coordinates and plotting a sphere (of any convenient radius). In case of the 
Octave script, the "sphere" function is used and plotted using the "surf" function 

OBJECTIVES:

1. To get fimiliarized with computer programming and solving scientific problems using
   computers.
2. To get fimiliarized with OCTAVE/MATLAB language and scientific computing in C.  


EXECUTION OF THE C CODE:
(For Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
	
To run the code manually:
1. Compile the C code "sphere3D.c" using a suitable compiler (gcc most preferentially).
2. Execute "gnuplot" command (install gnuplot from apt-get terminal command if not installed).
3. execute command: "load sphere3D.plt".

To run the the code automatically:
1. execute the command: "chmod +x sphere_program.sh" to make the Shell script executable.
2. execute the command: "./sphere_program.sh".

**In case of any errors generated during the automated execution of the code using the Shell
  script, check the "error_log.txt" file for any standard error messages produced during the
  execution.
     
EXECUTION OF THE OCTAVE CODE:

1. Execute the "octave" command or open the Octave GUI software.
2. Execute the "run sphere3D.m" command from the Octave prompt.
